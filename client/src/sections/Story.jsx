// The photograph was a rounded card beside the copy, which read as an
// illustration of the section. Full-bleed behind a scrim, it reads as the
// setting the copy is describing.
//
// It was the creek until 2026-08-16. That photograph moved to the
// hero as the opening shot of the camera move, and this section took the wide
// arrangement instead, which suits it better: "Our process" is about a finished
// piece, not a hillside.

                    Every piece begins with preserved moss, sourced from specialist growers who
                    harvest and treat it before it reaches the studio.

                <p className="mt-4 text-text-muted leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch] text-pretty">
                    Preserved moss is treated with a plant-based glycerin solution, which halts
                    ageing permanently, so it keeps its colour and softness for years with no
                    water and no light. What happens here is the design and the making: every
                    piece cut, arranged and mounted by hand.
