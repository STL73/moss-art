// The Spireforge mark — three ascending chevrons, each 0.75 the size of the one
// below it. Traced from the studio's own icon-only SVG
// (Claude Cowork/OUTPUTS/my-brand/01-LOGO-CORE/icon-*_2026-05-13_v1.svg), which
// keeps the coordinates identical to the brand asset.
//
// Drawn in currentColor rather than the brand's cyan and indigo. Those colours
// are correct for Spireforge and wrong for this footer: a bright cyan-to-indigo
// mark in a sage palette reads as something pasted in from another site, which
// is the opposite of what a build credit should do. Monochrome, it inherits the
// muted footer colour and travels to the accent on hover with the word beside
// it, so mark and text behave as one link.
//
// aria-hidden because the link it sits inside is already named "Site by
// Spireforge" — announcing the mark as well would say the name twice.
// 14px against the 12px text beside it: the mark is three stacked chevrons with
// air between them, so matching the type size exactly leaves it looking thinner
// than the word it belongs to.
